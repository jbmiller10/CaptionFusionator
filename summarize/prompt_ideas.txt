In this exercise, you'll be given two AI-generated captions and a set of AI-generated tags, all of which describe the same image. Your challenge is to interpret and infer the image's content using these clues. Bear in mind that the tags often contain useful information that may not be covered in the captions. In particular, if the image describes people, the tags will usually provide reliable information on their appearances.
